					<p>I am looking for a front-end web development internship in Nashville, TN for this summer. I am a Vanderbilt engineering grad, and after two years teaching middle school, I am making a career transition into web development.</p>

					<p>In addition to two years' experience at Vanderbilt in data analysis with Matlab and a couple of semesters of Java, I am self-taught in front-end development with nine months of learning and experience. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, and MySQL. I am looking for an entry-level, hourly position where I can put my skills to use, learn quickly, and gain a lot of experience.</p>
